# Welcome to Atmospheric Aesthetic Alien!

## About:
This is a basic platform game which gets increasingly wild after crossing each level.
You're high in the sky, an Alien from who knows what country, tasked with jumping anything and getting across some levels.
From starting with some basic jumps with blocks, to jumping on top of buildings from Malaysia for some appearent reason.

## Game Info:
Just click play, and try your best to get across!
